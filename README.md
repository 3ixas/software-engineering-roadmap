# 🔨️ Software Engineering Roadmap (Backend Focus)

> A self-directed journey from **Junior to Senior Backend Engineer**, aligned with **Finance & Risk Systems**, with optional exploration into **AI Infrastructure** and **Startup Systems**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository tracks my personal roadmap to mastering backend engineering fundamentals through hands-on projects, system design, and real-world application. It’s designed to:

* Cement deep computer science foundations
* Build robust backend systems in C#, Java, and Python
* Align with enterprise and high-performance finance environments
* Develop practical skills in architecture, testing, DevOps, and AI serving
* Showcase growth through reflections, structured challenges, and version-controlled work

This repo is my open-source commitment to **mastery through consistency and craft**.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

Each **checkpoint** in the roadmap includes:

* 🌟 A clear learning goal
* 🎓 Top course/video resources (free & paid)
* 🧪 A challenge/project to apply skills
* 📝 Reflections to reinforce learning and identify gaps

I follow the roadmap **chronologically** and commit regularly to show incremental progress, not perfection.

## 💬 Reflections

Each phase ends with a written reflection covering:

* What I learned
* What was challenging
* Tools/strategies that worked
* What I'd do differently
* How this phase connects to my long-term goals

## 🚀 Career Context

This roadmap was created to deepen my backend engineering skills and prepare for a high-impact role in a performance-critical, finance-aligned environment. It focuses on the real-world knowledge and systems thinking required to thrive in domains like risk analysis, backend infrastructure, and large-scale service design.

It also serves as a long-term foundation for my growth toward becoming a thoughtful, well-rounded senior software engineer – one who writes clean, maintainable code and builds systems that are fast, safe, and scalable.

This repository is my public commitment to that journey.

## 📈 Progress Tracker

Check [`progress.json`](./progress.json) for a snapshot of checkpoint status.
I update this manually as I complete and reflect on each learning milestone.
